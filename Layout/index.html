                <h3>What are Malware Attacks?</h3>
                <p>
                    Malware is an abbreviation of “malicious software”, which includes viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, and ransomware, and is the most common type of cyberattack. Malware infiltrates a system, usually via a link on an untrusted website or email or an unwanted software download. It deploys on the target system, collects sensitive data, manipulates and blocks access to network components, and may destroy data or shut down the system altogether.

                <p>
                    Using a VPN is a step in the right direction if you want to gain anonymity,
                    but VPNs aren’t exactly invisibility cloaks. In fact, 
                    using a VPN is just one step (though an important one!) out of the 22 steps that we’ll discuss below.
                    True online anonymity requires many changes to your digital routine, such as replacing your operating system,
                    browser, search engine, messaging apps, and email provider. Let’s take things one step at a time.
